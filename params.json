  "body": "### Barbershop Harmony, Refined\r\nQuintessence is a male _a cappella_ quartet dedicated to the fine art of barbershop and other close harmony choral styles. Our name brings to mind that special moment when all the notes in a chord are sung just right and the harmonic resonance produces a fifth note or overtone, as well as the medieval alchemists who sought the rare \"fifth element\" that could turn crude metals into gold.\r\n\r\n### Quartet Members\r\n* Preston Brown (tenor)\r\n* Mark Andromidas (lead)\r\n* McKay Perkins (baritone)\r\n* Carl Youngblood (bass)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nWe can help make your event unforgettable.
